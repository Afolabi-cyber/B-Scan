## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Upload an MRI Scan**: Users upload their MRI images through the web interface.
2. **AI Analysis**: The YOLOv8 model processes the image, detects any tumors, and generates a segmented overlay.
3. **Visual Results**: Displays the original image alongside the segmented output, making it easy to interpret results.
